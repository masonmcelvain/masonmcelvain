Hi! My name is Mason.

I write spicy love poems for [iFixit's](https://github.com/ifixit) servers. We empower people around the world to fix their stuff.

I graduated from [Cal Poly](https://www.calpoly.edu/) 📚, Computer Science class of 2022.

Visit my [home site](https://masonmcelvain.com) for a portfolio of my recent work. Thanks for stopping by! 👋🏻
