Similar to last year I made my way out to Joshua tree after Christmas with family and New Year's with friends in San Diego. Ryan and Alexa generously let me crash in their driveway for two weeks as a basecamp for climbing outings.

I mostly focused on bouldering this trip as I've been trying to get stronger and Ryan & Alexa are bouldering addicts. I sent a V5 crimp line called "JBMFP" (John Bachar Memorial Face Problem) that I was proud of and put a couple sessions into a cryptic arete called "Scatterbrain".

After "Scatterbrain" Ryan and I went to scope out a seldom-done highball V1 called "Air Rouhling". The climb features back-to-back all points off dynos, one run-and-jump from the ground and one sideways between jugs with a dreadful landing! We toproped it (until we core-shot my rope by accident) and then dialed in the starting dyno. It seemed much harder than V1... Ryan decided to play it safe and not attempt the sideways toss that day.

I also did some trad project shopping, sampling two of the most classic 12s in the park "Leave it to Beaver" (with Tommy) and "Equinox" (with Sean). Tommy was psyched on offwidth and roof climbs while Sean was psyched on splitter cracks, thin and wide! Nate introduced me to a chicken wing boulder called "Inquisition" by walking up and flashing it 😆

As the gods would have it I also ended up on a couple 5.11 splitters at Rusty Wall. Trad wasn't the focus of my trip but it's always fun to go through the redpoint process.

One day I ran into Isa, a friend from Moab. She had been travelling around the southwest picking up performance work. In Joshua Tree she sought out cool rocks to practice her silks on. In the evening she and her friends showed off their fire spinning skills. I gave it a whirl and gave myself a nice burn on the arm with the contact staff.

Aaaand of course I spent a lot of time playing with Pippin and Mona, dogs of Ryan and Alexa! Ryan and Alexa work at the Joshua Tree no-kill animal shelter which is rad.

I love visiting Joshua Tree, the desert feels good for my soul and tickles my nostalgia. I'm grateful for all the friends I got to pull on rocks with this trip, we tried hard and covered a lot of different styles. Time to drive back to Salt Lake and heal my shredded skin...
